# Rough Roadmap
1. Scrape relevant twitter data using APIs. 
2. Clean the data and come up with a methodology to identify the state of the individual based on the tweet. 
3. Infer the interconnection network using the interactions of other individuals with a given tweet. 
4. After the interconnection network is built, run multiple simulations to estimate the parameters in a maximum likelihood fashion.
